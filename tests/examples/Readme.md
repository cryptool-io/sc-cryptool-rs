### Examples

Please check the main Readme file for details on each endpoint.

The endoints present in these examples have 2 corresponding files, one ending in _..Payload_ which forms the payload that the _..Call_ file will use to call the SC endpoint.

The _signedData_ file loads the pem files, forms the address objects and signs the data. You will need to use the _ContractLoader_ as present here in your project.

You can run the _..Call_ files in the order present here to go through the intire flow of the SCs deployment and usage.
